INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================================================

STEP 1: Locate Your Elden Ring Game Folder
-------------------------------------------
Find your Elden Ring installation directory. Common locations:

  Steam (default):
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game

  Steam (custom drive):
    [Drive]:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game

  Epic Games:
    C:\Program Files\Epic Games\ELDEN RING\Game

You need to find the folder that contains "eldenring.exe"


STEP 2: Copy All Files
-----------------------
1. Copy ALL contents of this package folder
2. Paste them into your Elden Ring Game folder
3. When prompted, choose to merge/overwrite folders

You should end up with these in your Game folder:
  - SeamlessCoop\ folder
  - mod\ folder
  - modengine2\ folder
  - config_eldenring.toml file
  - launchmod_eldenring.bat file
  - modengine2_launcher.exe file
  - ersc_launcher.exe file
  - (plus all the original game files)


STEP 3: Launch the Game
------------------------
IMPORTANT: Do NOT launch from Steam!

To play with mods:
  1. Navigate to your Game folder in File Explorer
  2. Double-click "launchmod_eldenring.bat"
  3. The game will launch with both mods loaded

===============================================================================
USING THE MODS
===============================================================================

SEAMLESS CO-OP
--------------
- Loads automatically when you use launchmod_eldenring.bat
- In-game, access the co-op menu to create or join sessions
- To play with friends:
  1. One person creates a session (you'll get a session ID)
  2. Share the session ID with friends
  3. Friends join using that ID

- Password: Configured in SeamlessCoop\cooppassword.ini
  (both players must have the same password to connect)


MAP FOR GOBLINS
---------------
The map mod is DISABLED by default. To enable it:

  1. Start the game (via launchmod_eldenring.bat)
  2. Rest at ANY Site of Grace
  3. Look for a NEW menu option (likely "Map Configuration")
  4. Select which markers you want to see:
     - Sites of Grace
     - Bosses and their drops
     - Unique items
     - NPCs and enemies
     - Chests and loot
     - And many more...
  5. Open your world map (press G or M)
  6. You'll now see detailed markers!

NOTE: Contains spoilers! Icons disappear as you complete content.

===============================================================================
MULTIPLAYER SETUP (Playing with Friends)
===============================================================================

FOR CO-OP BETWEEN MULTIPLE MACHINES:
------------------------------------
1. Install this package on BOTH machines (same steps above)
2. Make sure both use the SAME password:
   - Open: SeamlessCoop\cooppassword.ini
   - Set the same password on both machines
3. Both players launch via launchmod_eldenring.bat
4. One player creates session, shares the session ID
5. Other player joins using that ID

===============================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================================

PROBLEM: Game doesn't launch at all
SOLUTION: 
  - Make sure you're using launchmod_eldenring.bat, NOT Steam
  - Check that all files copied correctly
  - Try running launchmod_eldenring.bat as Administrator

PROBLEM: Game launches but no Seamless Co-op menu
SOLUTION:
  - Verify you launched via launchmod_eldenring.bat
  - Check modengine2\logs folder for error messages

PROBLEM: Map looks the same (no new markers)
SOLUTION:
  - The mod is OFF by default
  - Rest at a Site of Grace
  - Look for Map Configuration menu option
  - Enable the marker categories you want

PROBLEM: Can't connect to friend in co-op
SOLUTION:
  - Both must have IDENTICAL mod setup
  - Both must use SAME password (cooppassword.ini)
  - Both must launch via launchmod_eldenring.bat
  - Make sure session ID is typed correctly

PROBLEM: Steam won't let me play / EasyAntiCheat error
SOLUTION:
  - This is normal - don't launch from Steam
  - Always use launchmod_eldenring.bat instead
  - Playing with mods means no Steam achievements/online

===============================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
===============================================================================

DO:
  ✓ Always launch using launchmod_eldenring.bat
  ✓ Enable map markers at Sites of Grace
  ✓ Use same password for co-op between machines

DON'T:
  ✗ Launch from Steam's "Play" button (mods won't work)
